Is your computer dragging and frustrating you daily? You're not alone. Over time, even powerful systems can slow down due to software bloat, outdated components, overheating, or malware. This guide will walk you through how to fix a slow computer—from cleaning up software to upgrading parts—with tools and products you can find directly on Amazon.

🧹 1. Clean Up Bloatware & Junk Files

Why It Matters:

Unnecessary apps, background processes, and junk files can clog up your PC's memory and startup.

Why It Matters:

Viruses, spyware, and cryptominers can slow your system, steal data, and overload CPU/GPU.
